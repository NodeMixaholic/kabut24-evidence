# kabut24 evidence
pls github shut this guy down

Report statement:
```
* Domains belong to my mother, I have access to the DNS records via cloudflare.
* I attempted to redirect my former GH Pages domain to a new GH pages CNAME record ([www.]nodemixaholic.com) via cname on old record (www.)sparksammy.com
* It didn't work.
* I was too lazy and dumb to change it.
* Kabut24 exploited the security vurn. I forgot about to redirect to their own GitHub pages instance.

This is unacceptable behavior from Kabut's part, and I'm sure you agree. I have since deleted the CNAME, thereby mitigating the issue.
However, this may still be happening to others, which is sad.
Please see the evidence here:

Thanks,
